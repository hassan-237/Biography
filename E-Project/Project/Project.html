In 1880, the family moved to Munich's borough of Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.</p>

                        <li>Influence of Gymnasium Education: The Luitpold Gymnasium provided Einstein with a strong foundation in mathematics and physics This period introduced him to formal learning at a young age.

                         <p>In 1895, at the age of sixteen, Einstein sat the entrance examination for the federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zürich, Switzerland. He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the test,[33] but performed with distinction in physics and mathematics.[34] On the advice of the polytechnic's principal, he completed his secondary education at the Argovian cantonal school (a gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, graduating in 1896.While lodging in Aarau with the family of Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. (His sister, Maja, later married Winteler's son Paul).</p>

                            <li>Age 26 (1905): Earns his Ph.D. from the University of Zürich with a thesis on the size of molecules. During this year, he publishes his groundbreaking papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²).</li>

                    <p>Albert Einstein's name is synonymous with genius, and for good reason. His revolutionary theories not only transformed our understanding of the universe but also laid the foundation for modern physics. Here's a closer look at some of his most significant achievements:</p>

                    <p>Until 1905, scientists believed light behaved solely as a wave. This theory couldn't explain why shining light on certain metals ejected electrons (the photoelectric effect). Einstein proposed a radical idea: light energy comes in packets called quanta (later named photons). These photons have energy proportional to their frequency. When a photon strikes a metal atom, it transfers its entire energy to an electron, knocking it out if the energy is sufficient. This explained the photoelectric effect and paved the way for quantum mechanics, a foundational theory in physics dealing with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level.</p>

                    <p>Robert Brown observed pollen grains in water undergoing a jittery, random movement. This puzzled scientists as no known force seemed responsible. Einstein used statistical mechanics to explain this phenomenon. He theorized that the water molecules were constantly bombarding the pollen grains, causing their erratic movement. This provided strong evidence for the existence of atoms, a fundamental building block of matter, and their constant motion.</p>

                    <p>Newtonian physics considered space and time to be absolute and independent. Einstein's special theory of relativity challenged this notion. He proposed that the speed of light is constant in a vacuum, regardless of the motion of the observer. This led to the concepts of time dilation (time runs slower for objects moving close to the speed of light) and length contraction (objects in motion appear shorter in the direction of their motion).</p>

                        <p>Before Einstein, gravity was understood as a force attracting objects with mass. However, this explanation had limitations. Einstein proposed a revolutionary view of gravity, describing it not as a force but as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. Imagine a bowling ball placed on a trampoline, creating a dip. Similarly, massive objects warp spacetime, influencing the movement of other objects within that warped space. This had a significant impact on astronomy and cosmology, providing a framework for understanding black holes, gravitational waves, and the structure of the universe.</p>
